<p>Here is a small post inspired by this <a href="http://www.kennethreitz.org/values/">one</a>. Idea is to have a core set of values
which form an underlying cushion for all the decisions I make especially the 
crucial and difficult ones. Readers are welcome to comment some of the values which
have held them through tough spots. It would be incredible to have some anecdotes too. 
I’d try adding some for mine.</p>

<p>So in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Simple is good, complicated is bad.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Differentiate yourself from others.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Run from negativity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stay happy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Disciplined life makes you feel good about yourself.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Life’s not a race, but there’s no speed limit either.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be genuinely interested in people.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unshakeable self-confidence and unfaltering enthusiasm is key to winning battles we fight.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
