<p>I wrote this poem when I was going through a very low phase in life.
Many of my beliefs were shaken and I used to feel very helpless. I had to swallow a lot of pride and crawl 
back to life. The pain in chest and the weakness in knees were some physical symptoms of the emotional turmoil I was in.
I hope this little poem conveys the intensity of emotions which we as humans are capable of facing.</p>

<p>Numb, inert and sickened<br />
Clutch in the stomach so tight<br />
Watching the room clock<br />
Slowly go tik tok tik tok</p>

<p>Easy to fight with foes<br />
Much harder with friends<br />
All your shots but some<br />
Hurt you more than them</p>

<p>The struggle is worthless<br />
The pain is crippling<br />
Watch again the room clock<br />
Go slower tik tok tik tok\</p>

<p>But as with any suffering and pain, you only grow wiser and stronger. As Rumi says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The wound is the place where the Light enters you.</p>
