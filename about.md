title: About me
---

Hi, I am Anurag. I live in Bengaluru, India. I have always wanted to write, and this blog is my attempt at it. 
I studied Maths and Literature at IIT Kanpur. 

I grew up in New Delhi, India, which is a really big and happening city and there's a really good chance you'll easily get lost in the hustle.
And now I live in Bengaluru, where the weather is so good that you will never want to leave.
