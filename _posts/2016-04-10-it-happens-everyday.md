I saw your pic on my wall,\\
Jitters down my spine,\\
Blood flow did a dizzying fall,\\
It went all cold inside.
 
Hands had mind of their own,\\
I almost messaged you.\\
They didn’t stop till the phone was thrown,\\
Tang!!!!!  Crashing to the floor.
 
Heart stopped beating, something choked inside,\\
Breath went cold and shallow.\\
You’ll call first, to myself I lied,\\
And closed my eyes to save myself.
 
After few long breaths, I retrieve\\
Normalcy and sanity comes back to me.\\
Is this the elusive love my eve?\\
Almost like a seizure…\\
Phew.....
