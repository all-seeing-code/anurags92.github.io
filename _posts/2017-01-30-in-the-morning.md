Yes it is 5:00 am in the morning of January 30, 2017. This is turning out to be the heaviest semester of my undergraduate studies in college. 
Pity that it is also the last one. 
I have a presentation due tomorrow for Lambda Calculus. 
After that I am due on assignments for Non Linear Regression, Inference and Integral Equations. I am also caught up in “data science consultancy” service (which I like to call it) which I provide to this awesome thing my friends at GS are doing. Feminist theory and literature has a play to read and discuss and I need to start thinking concretely on the upcoming project on Data in Feminism and vice - versa. This week also start lectures on Galois Theory.

My semester has become a potpourri of Statistics, Abstract maths, data science and feminism. Wish it gave good fragrance at the least. Help me save the shire! 

Gosh, I am hamlet on attending a wedding ceremony. 
To be or not to be.

I also need to handle the bookings to Amsterdam and Brussels.
J-1 Visa application also needs to be taken care of.

I am feeling bad because I am missing my workouts because of all this. How long can this be sustained? I should come up with a working plan for this. 

For first time this load has become scary to say the least. It feels like I am back in a crazy semester and want few more hours everyday.

Note to self: Never rely on RedBulls to help you in assignments. I drank two cans straight and now my eyes are puffy and wanna sleep but here I am frantically writing this blog post which no one is gonna read.
