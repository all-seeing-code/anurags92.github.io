I quit GS after spending almost three years with the team. It wasn't an easy decision but I felt that I want to do something radically new for next couple of years. Below is my farewell letter to the team I worked with. I will miss the genuinely smart and caring people I met while working at GS. Also had the privilege to be mentored and managed by some of the best folks I have ever met.

Hey

As some of you may know, today is my last day at the firm. While I am very excited about the next phase in my career, I am also sad saying goodbye to you all. Coming to GS has been very fulfilling and better than what I had imagined while preparing for internship interviews circa 2015. I am very grateful to my managers Advait, Manjunath and Sanyam and entire MRM for providing an environment very conducive for my personal and professional growth. I am grateful to my Strat friends in Credit, Core Quant, EM LDN, Latam and Rates for bringing very interesting projects and problems to look at. Finally I am also very thankful to Gopi, Bill, Bingwen and Ankit for being the leaders that they are and being the figures one can aspire to emulate one day.

 

I had read _My life as a quant_ in my freshman year in 2012 and it was quite serendipitous that I ended up joining DA which has its roots in a team that Derman started. Well, since then I have read other books and am looking forward to explore other directions. As for the next steps, I will be based in Bangalore working on open source databases which is as different from IR curves as it could get.

 

Lastly, I am sure we will all keep on working hard, uphold the highest standards and make this institution proud and our clients happy. I will miss you all and will try to keep in touch.

Thanks
Anurag
