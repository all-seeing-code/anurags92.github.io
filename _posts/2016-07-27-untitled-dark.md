I wrote this poem when I was going through a very low phase in life. 
Many of my beliefs were shaken and I had to swallow a lot of pride and crawl 
back to life. I hope this little poem conveys the intensity of emotions which 
we as humans are capable of facing.

Numb, inert and sickened\\
Clutch in the stomach so tight\\
Watching the room clock\\
Slowly go tik tok tik tok\\

Easy to fight with foes\\
Much harder with friends\\
All your shots but some\\
Hurt you more than them\\

The struggle is worthless\\
The pain is crippling\\
Watch again the room clock\\
Go slower tik tok tik tok\\
