Numb, inert and sickened\\ 
Clutch in the stomach so tight\\
Watching the room clock\\
Slowly go tik tok tik tok\\

Easy to fight with foes\\
Much harder with friends\\
All your shots but some\\
Hurt you more than them\\

The struggle is worthless\\
The pain is crippling\\
Watch again the room clock\\
Go slower tik tok tik tok\\
