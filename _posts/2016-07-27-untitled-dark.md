I wrote this poem when I was going through a very low phase in life.
Many of my beliefs were shaken and I used to feel very helpless. I had to swallow a lot of pride and crawl 
back to life. The pain in chest and the weakness in knees were some physical symptoms of the emotional turmoil I was in.
I hope this little poem conveys the intensity of emotions which we as humans are capable of facing.



Numb, inert and sickened\\
Clutch in the stomach so tight\\
Watching the room clock\\
Slowly go tik tok tik tok

Easy to fight with foes\\
Much harder with friends\\
All your shots but some\\
Hurt you more than them

The struggle is worthless\\
The pain is crippling\\
Watch again the room clock\\
Go slower tik tok tik tok

But as with any suffering and pain, you only grow wiser and stronger. As Rumi says:
>The wound is the place where the Light enters you.
