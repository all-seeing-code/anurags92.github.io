title: Failed interview

Okay, last weekend I flunked an interview. It was the usual tech interview with not so difficult question. 
But I have been berating myself a lot for flunking that. It is not the first time I have done bad in such
an interview. I have a knack for such failures too. Haha. I am writing this post to put an end to the cribbing 
I have been doing over this one specially. 

Thanks to Muskan for being there. She is such a gem and always has the best idioms to poke fun at me. 

I have to have better goals now! Would finish on the books which are lining up on my desk. 

Here is pic of my desk currently :)
