Do I say what I say?\\
And mean what I mean?\\
Why my words are so gay?\\
Whereas joy inside, so lean

Do I sing the song which you listen?\\
Or play the tune which you hum,\\
'Cause you smile but my eyes glisten\\
Ans matching moves fail to come

Letters, words, lines and prose,\\
Shades of ink on paper they lay.\\
Commas, stops and spaces around those,\\
Speak the things which words can say

Listen to the sounds of silence, dear\\
Music reverberates pure and true.\\
It says the things and says them clear,\\
And for a change means them too...
