I like collecting pearls of wisdom that I come across while reading books, blogs and poems. 
Below is a growing collection of such tidbits. I'd try adding notes to some of the quotes which really struck me at some point of time or helped me in a difficult phase of life.



>Then out spake brave Horatius,\\
>The Captain of the Gate:\\
>To every man upon this earth\\
>Death cometh soon or late.\\
>And how can man die better\\
>Than facing fearful odds,\\
>For the ashes of his fathers,\\
>And the temples of his gods\\
>                         --- Thomas Babington Macaulay, Lays of Ancient Rome 

This was one of the first quotes which I memorized. I was introduced to this poem by my late grandfather whom I idolize. 
It speaks of patriotism and valour. Sadly I have not yet felt that kind of patriotism for the nation but I feel a strong desire to work for the poor and destitute of the country.
