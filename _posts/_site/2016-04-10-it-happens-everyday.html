<p>I saw your pic on my wall,<br />
Jitters down my spine,<br />
Blood flow did a dizzying fall,<br />
It went all cold inside.</p>

<p>Hands had mind of their own,<br />
I almost messaged you.<br />
They didn’t stop till the phone was thrown,<br />
Tang!!!!!  Crashing to the floor.</p>

<p>Heart stopped beating, something choked inside,<br />
Breath went cold and shallow.<br />
You’ll call first, to myself I lied,<br />
And closed my eyes to save myself.</p>

<p>After few long breaths, I retrieve<br />
Normalcy and sanity comes back to me.<br />
Is this the elusive love my eve?<br />
Almost like a seizure…<br />
Phew…..</p>
