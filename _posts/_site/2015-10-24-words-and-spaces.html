<p>Do I say what I say?<br />
And mean what I mean?<br />
Why my words are so gay?<br />
Whereas joy inside, so lean</p>

<p>Do I sing the song which you listen?<br />
Or play the tune which you hum,<br />
‘Cause you smile but my eyes glisten<br />
And matching moves fail to come</p>

<p>Letters, words, lines and prose,<br />
Shades of ink on paper they lay.<br />
Commas, stops and spaces around those,<br />
Speak the things which words can’t say</p>

<p>Listen to the sounds of silence, dear<br />
Music reverberates pure and true.<br />
It says the things and says them clear,<br />
And for a change means them too…</p>
