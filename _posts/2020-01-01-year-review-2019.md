Year 2019 in review. 

It feels good to be back to blogging after an almost two year long hiatus. 2019 is special in a sense that it wraps a very formative decade for me. I finished my high-school, university and started a career all in this decade.
It also feels special because almost all my lasting relationships (romantic and non-romantic) were formed in this decade. I am very thankful for having come across such a wonderful bunch of folks and really cherish having them around. 

As the decade comes to the wrap I want to note three things which I learnt from three very special people:
- From S: Being assertive when the need comes.
- From M: Being selfless and caring in love.
- From L: Being a fighter and not settling for less than what you think you deserve.

My lifestyle and choices in past few years have also made me understand few basic principles I like to live with. I like simplicity in design, code, and conversations. I like when people don't have to second guess what I mean when I say something and consequently I do not like to be forced to second guess people and their actions. 
Another idea which has been going around my mind for sometime is that I want to work for a greater purpose than just for myself. In someways if my work and skills could impact the nation or the society in a positive way would bring a lot more fulfillment for me.
